To log in as an Admin, go to Restaurant Owner login and use the Admin code "nimda" (admin spelled backwards).

To make a reservation, a Consumer searches for a table at a specific restaurant/time/day/number of guests, gets a list of available tables, and clicks on the "Make Reservation" button next to the desired table.

We would like to remind Professor Heineman that we need a regrade on the Admin functionality for iteration 1. We had the functionality on time, but forgot to add the admin password to our comments. Professor Heineman had said he would give us full points on the Admin use cases because of this. Additionally, there were some RDS pieces we got points off for when we shouldn't have. We discussed these with him as well. The list of things that we should not have gotten points off for in iteration 1 are in an email to Professor Heineman as well as a Discord message (should be from chooboy).

Used as final project for CS 3733 Software Engineering.
